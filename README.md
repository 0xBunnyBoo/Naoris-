What is Naoris Protocol?
Universal Trust Layer For All Devices
Mission
Naoris Protocol's mission is to restore cyber-trust in digital systems and enhance data quality while delivering verified cyber-status beyond traditional perimeters

About Naoris Protocol
Naoris Protocol is a self-validating, cybersecurity and trust enforcement protocol that enables continuous verification and validation of devices, networks, processes and systems.

It is built upon a pioneering EVM-compatible post-quantum, sub-zero layer blockchain, custom-built Decentralized Proof of Security (dPoSec) trust consensus mechanism and Decentralized AI, that redefines the way global digital systems are protected.

It leverages the collective power of incentivized devices to create the world’s first Decentralized Trust Mesh which is a dedicated DePIN that significantly elevates levels of cybersecurity and digital trust.

Naoris Protocol provides users, enterprise, and governments the trusted cyber-assurance needed to secure and manage systems, partners and assets outside the traditional perimeter. By enabling validated and shared ‘proof of trust’ between organizations, networks, systems and processes that previously could not trust each other, Naoris Protocol is powering the transition from isolated castles, to incentivized community models of computing.

Operating under the dPoSec trust consensus mechanism, the mesh achieves three core objectives:

Reduces cyber threats & cyber unknowns by an order of magnitude

Provides real time-shared proof of trust and cyber-status between multiple parties

Exponentially increases the quality of data and its value

By securely validating the systems that rely on high quality data from outside the classic cybersecurity perimeter, Naoris delivers zero trust architecture for data and assets.

Unlike traditional, centralized security systems that rely on a single point of defense, the decentralized nature of Naoris Protocol’s cyber-mesh ensures all participating devices are incetivized to act as secure validator nodes.

Devices acting as security nodes are rewarded with $NAORIS tokens within a device-to-device ‘proof of trust’ economy for actively maintaining and contributing to overall system security. Rather than being mere passive elements, validator nodes enhance system security and autonomously establish trust.

Such an incentive model promotes widespread and proactive participation among all collaborating partners, creating secure and robust infrastructure beyond traditional boundaries.

Naoris Protocol provides provable cybersecurity controls to Web2, Web3, DePINs, Mesh and multi-party environments, making networks stronger as they grow, not weaker.

Why Naoris Protocol?
Traditional cybersecurity solutions are failing to keep up with the complexity our hyper-connected digital world, which currently stands at over 50 billion online devices. Naoris Protocol enables the transition from traditional enterprise based isolated castles to incentivized community computing models, that provide a new cybersecurity paradigm, designed to scale and secure the digital world of the future.

The current risk of systemic cybersecurity failure cannot be solved by a traditionally framed company, as the company itself could become a single point of failure. Here are some key reasons to choose Naoris Protocol.

Unstoppable
It is always on, devices and networks can adopt it or abandon it, but it carries on.

Permissionless
Users and builders cannot be de-platformed, it's censorship resistant and accessible by anyone.

Minimally Extractive
Near zero fees reducing costs for validation and real time audits, creating new opportunities to measure any asset.

Valuable
Audited assets are more valuable than unaudited assets. Always on, continuous validation of the environment means all associated assets are producing high quality data.

Expansive
It has built-in incentives for users to behave fairly and for builders to build on top of it.

Positive Sum
The more users, the more valuable the results, a win-win for all participants. Network effects contribute dramatically to the value of measured assets and the higher quality data they produce.
